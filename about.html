                <p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife Department which was notified as an attached Department in August, 1994,
                    started as wing of Forest Department in 1975. The Wildlife Organization in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
                    Province emerged in 1974 as an ex-cadre wing of the Forest Department under the administrative
                    control of Chief Conservator of Forests. This wing functioned for 4 years as a non significant and
                    low priority organization and was ultimately abolished in 1978 under an economy drive. Conservation
                    of wildlife again became a priority and the wildlife wing was re-established in 1981. Conservation
                    awareness and priority reached a high mark in 1995 when the wildlife wing was given the status of an
                    "Attached Department" within Forest, Fisheries and Wildlife Department and Conservator Wildlife was
                    declared as Head of the Department.</p>
